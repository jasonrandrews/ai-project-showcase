# How to Contribute a Project Card

1. Go to `src/pages/projects/`.
2. Copy `sample-project.md` and rename it to something unique (e.g. `my-cool-project.md`).
3. Edit the frontmatter at the top:

```
---
title: "Your Project Title"
summary: "A short summary of your project."
link: "https://link-to-your-project.com"
---
```

4. Optionally, add a longer description below the frontmatter (not shown on the card).
5. Open a pull request with your new file!

- No images are needed.
