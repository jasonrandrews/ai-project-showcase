## Challenge

AI tools have turbo-charged developer workflows, expanding what we **can** build. The harder question is **what we *ought* to build**. When teams chase narrow metrics, “success” can appear as a mirage as user trust erodes, reputational risk rises, and long-term value shrinks.

Developers need a lightweight, repeatable way to **bake responsible-AI thinking into everyday workflows** so they can spot downstream impacts *before* launch. All without slowing velocity.

## Solution

The Yellow Team methodology was distilled from industry best practice (source [here](https://consilienceproject.org/development-in-progress/) and [here](https://www.humanetech.com/course)) into actionable steps for Arm software developers. YellowTeamGPT was built to help developers think through product-design consequences up front, ensuring we build the *best* thing quickly instead of building something terrible quickly.

## AI developer tools used

- OpenAI custom GPT

## Results

YellowTeamGPT was used to build YellowTeamGPT, to great effect. I also dog fooded it to build [AI-generated personalized Learning Path contributor emails](/projects/learning-path-email-report) in a way that created positive incentives without discouraging people.

Using YellowTeamGPT enabled:
* **Rapid ideation:** Responsible AI reviews in minutes instead of weeks with automated feature suggestions to kickstart brainstorming.
* **Avoiding negative outcomes:** Identified unintentionally discouraging framing in the AI contributor email letter, and brainstormed better implementation creating a win-win.
* **Competitive edge:** The competitive value of Yellow Teaming has been recognized inside and outside Arm, with YellowTeamGPT being shown at We Are Developers in a 2 hour developer workshop, showcased at the PyTorch Conference 2025 Arm booth, and more.
